SQL for Data Analysis 

**🧠 Objective:**
This analysis dives deep into the sales and customer behavior of an eCommerce business. The goal is to uncover trends, highlight inefficiencies, and propose actionable strategies to optimize performance across product categories, customer segments, and locations.

**🔍 What We Did:**
We used SQL to analyze structured data from a simulated eCommerce database that includes:
   Customers
   Products
   Orders
   Order Items
We created optimized SQL queries to extract insights, measure key performance indicators, and reveal hidden patterns in user behavior, revenue, and product demand.

**📈 Key Business Insights:

🛍️ Top Performing Products:
Electronics lead the revenue chart, with Laptops being the highest contributor.
Accessories like Headphones, though lower in price, show high volume sales — a strong upsell opportunity.

📍 Market Segmentation & Geography:
USA and Canada generated the highest revenue.
Customers from Tier 1 cities showed consistent buying patterns with higher Average Order Values (AOV).
However, Tier 2 and 3 cities had untapped potential — low sales but growing user base.

👤 Customer Behavior:
Repeat customers from the USA have a higher lifetime value (LTV).
Average revenue per user (ARPU) is highest in Canada, indicating premium customer behavior.

🧾 Order Trends:
Peak sales occurred in Q1, possibly due to New Year promotions.
March had the lowest revenue, suggesting a seasonal dip or marketing gap.

⚠️ Identified Gaps:
Low product diversification in non-electronic categories.
Underperformance in Tier 2/3 cities — requires focused regional marketing.
Lack of cart conversion data limits deeper funnel analysis.

**🧭 Strategic Recommendations:**

**Boost Marketing in Tier 2/3 Cities**
Use geo-targeted promotions and localized offers to convert growing interest into sales.

**Leverage High-Volume Accessories**
Bundle low-price, high-demand items (like Headphones) with premium products.

**Enhance Product Range**
Introduce new categories in health, kitchen, or lifestyle — especially for regions with untapped demand.

**Time Promotions Effectively**
Increase marketing efforts in February and March to balance out revenue drops.

**Build Loyalty Programs**
Especially for top ARPU regions to boost retention and repeat purchases.

**📌 Outcome:**
By harnessing SQL, we transformed raw data into actionable business intelligence.
This analysis provides a roadmap to optimize sales, target specific customer segments, and scale business operations strategically.
